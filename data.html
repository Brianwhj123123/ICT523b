<h1>1、Alliance with other brands</h1>
<p>One of the most attractive benefits of alliance with other enterprises
is the opportunity to provide supplementary services to customers, otherwise these services will not be available. Paying attention to the
core competitiveness of enterprises is very important to the success
of enterprises, because when an enterprise becomes a master in all
walks of life, it becomes a master who is good for nothing. By
strengthening the alliance with other brands, the company can
improve its popularity and attract more customers to buy.</p>

increase the number of potential new customers. Every time you
enter a new market, you can pave the way for business growth and
revenue growth. Companies can also use the international market to
launch unique products and services, which helps to maintain a
positive source of revenue. By expanding the foreign market, we can
expand the brand awareness of the company.</p>
